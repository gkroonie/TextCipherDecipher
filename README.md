A CIPHER AND DECIPHER PROGRAM:

This was my first Python project. The cipher works on a Ceaser-Cipher-like shift register.

It is written to work on a Windows 10 machine and saves the Cipher text (from the Encryptor) and the Deciphered text (from the Decryptor) to the desktop in separate text files.
